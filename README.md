# SEAMM Flowchart viewer

You can view a sample flowchart made using `cytoscape.js` by cloning this repository and opening `sample.html` in your browser (note that you can't move this html file and still see the demo if you move the file because it uses css and javascript that is in the repository)

## To use the web flowchart viewer
Create a conda environment which has flask installed. 

You can then run the viewer by typing 

```
python main.py
```

in your terminal.

Open a browser and navigate to `localhost:5000` to start using the viewer. You can view the demo, or upload your own flowchart.
